Want to merging with branching that I use temporary to not create any extra file:


*git branch 'file'
*git checkout 'file'  //With this switching part can be done.
*make some modification as per your choice with the existing file.
*git status //Optional to check
*git add 'file' //Staging the file yeeah;)
*make the commit , name then -m (message)
*git status //Optional

=> Going back to master class to just override temporary things into the longer one.

*git checkout master //switching from temporary branch to master
*git status //Optional , but better to check before and after merging files on it.
*git merge 'file' //Do not forget to do this once youre in master class +++


=> Once merging has done, you can delete the temporary branch that created to override codes.

*git branch -d 'file'
*git status //Now perhaps you're advised to push the master branch into the origin server, aren't you??

**git push origin master
with this, merging part is done, go back to the origin and check the commits navigation.
Regards,
